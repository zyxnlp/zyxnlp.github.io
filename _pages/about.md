I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science from Beijing Institute of Technology, where I was co-advised by [Prof. Lejian Liao](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/llj/index.htm) and [Prof. Yang Gao](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/fjs/gy_/index.htm). I am now visiting at Singapore University of Technology and Design, under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei).

I am interested in designing machine learning algorithms for solving natural language processing (NLP) problems, with a specific focus on sentiment analysis, semantic representation and pre-trained language models. Currently, I am working on natural language generation (NLG).
