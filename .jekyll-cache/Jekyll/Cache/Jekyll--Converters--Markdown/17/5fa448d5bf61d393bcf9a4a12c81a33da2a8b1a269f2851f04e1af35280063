I"á<p>I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science from Beijing Institute of Technology, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/llj/index.htm">Prof. Lejian Liao</a> and <a href="https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/fjs/gy_/index.htm">Prof. Yang Gao</a>. I am now visiting at Singapore University of Technology and Design, under the supervision of <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei">Prof. Wei Lu</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in designing machine learning algorithms for solving natural language processing (NLP) problems, with a specific focus on sentiment analysis, semantic representation and pre-trained language models. Currently, I am working on natural language generation (NLU).</p>
